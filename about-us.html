        <h2>🌸 Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          We are a team of passionate students from <strong>Tarlac State University - College of Computer Studies</strong> united by one goal:
          to grow together as we learn, code, and create. Our project — <em>Team Portfolio: Seasons of Creativity</em> —
          showcases not only our individual strengths but also how we flourish when we work as one.

        <h2>🍂 Our Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Nature reminds us that every season has its own beauty, just like every person has unique talents.
          Spring symbolizes our fresh ideas, Summer our energy, Autumn our maturity, and Winter our clarity.
          Together, these seasons represent the cycle of creativity and teamwork that defines us.
